    <h3> Eldorado Georgetown Planting Map</h3>
    <div>
        <p> This is a fairly standard contract map for the Forest Service. For this map, I was given raw data for the
            outline of the units. I coordinated with the Timber team to digitize, clean up, and then classify units.
            The map is used for informing prospective contractors of size and location of units, and if they choose to
            take the contract, the map would be used in Avenza to determine boundaries</p>

    <h3>Lake Tahoe Basin Motor Vehicle Use Map</h3>
    <div>
        <p> This was the first priority during my internship with the Forest Service. MVUMs represent roads and motorized
            trails for the public to use. It is important that they are accurate and updated for the safety of guest and
            employees. My role in this map was to meet biweekly with the road and the trail coordinators for the Tahoe Basin
            and make the spatial edits that they request. Imagery and Lidar data were also used for reference, as well
            as internal Forest Service tools for quality assurance.</p>
