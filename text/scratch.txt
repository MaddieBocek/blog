        The internet felt intimate in the beginning. Media that previously needed approval from high-ups could be published based on the
        wants of the author. People couldn't wait to share about their everyday lives. Any mundane task, any everyday emotion that would have
        previously been struck down could be viewed by millions. There was a new format of connection through authenticity, defined by the
        amount of life you are willing to share online.
