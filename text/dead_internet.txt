The second I saw someone with a butterfly tramp stamp I knew who I wanted to be. It went against everything I saw in suburbia:
low class with a sexual innuendo. I wanted to rebel, but I wanted people to rebel with me. Like so many other pre-teens in 2011,
I turned to Tumblr, Reddit, and personal blogs to fulfill that hole. It was a time when personal expression was valued over
possessions. What music did you listen to? How did you do your makeup? Spending time in those communities online slowly transitioned
to being in these communities in real life. I was friends with people who were musicians and did stick and poke tattoos. The hole was
half filled now.

I’ve mellowed slightly in the years since. I have a medium paying government job. I hike and camp on the weekends. Sobriety is
something I really value. am still amassing tattoos and going to concerts. I’ve missed the beauty subcultures I was in, and
now have the money to afford the pricier options that I could only year for as a teenager. These communities have been stripped of
all creativity and sold for parts. I see so many PR reviews and almost no tutorials. You cannot form an opinion on every product
after one day. Clean girl? What the hell is that. Everyone has natural hair in a perfect blowout. At some point, every internet
subculture has pivoted from uniqueness to conformity and capitalism. I used to be able to search for a new lipstick and see swatches
and reviews from everyday people. If I search now, the entire first page of google is just links to buy the product. Social media
used to show me my friends. Just ads now. My reddit feed keeps pushing popular content and news that I do not want to see. I swear we
used to have it better. Anyway use my code ‘SPINSTERCORE’ for 0% off everything at any store because I am a failure at capitalism.

Remember, if you’re too drunk to drive, you’re the perfect level of drunk to call your senator.
